# Helix: A Modern, Secure Version Control System

Helix is a next-generation version control system inspired by Git, but designed for **maximum security, auditability, and decentralization**. It combines the best ideas from distributed VCS, blockchain, and modern cryptography to provide a robust, user-friendly, and tamper-proof code management experience.

Built in **Rust** for performance, memory safety, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Features

### 1. **Cryptographically Secure Commit History**
- **SHA-256 Merkle DAG**: Every commit forms a node in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which supports complex merge scenarios
- **Tamper-Evident Chain**: Each commit includes a cryptographic hash of its parent(s) and content to form an immutable chain
- **Ed25519 Digital Signatures**: Every commit is cryptographically signed
- **Collision Resistance**: SHA-256 provides 128-bit collision resistance against quantum attacks

### 2. **Advanced Key Management System**
- **Ed25519 Keypairs**: Uses state-of-the-art elliptic curve cryptography for optimal security/performance ratio
- **Local Key Storage**: Keys stored securely in `~/.helix/keys/ed25519.key` with proper file permissions
- **Key Rotation Support**: Built-in commands for key generation, import, export, and rotation
- **Multi-Identity Support**: Framework for managing multiple signing identities per repository

### 3. **Signature Verification Pipeline**
- **Pre-Push Verification**: Complete ancestry validation before any remote operations
- **Post-Pull Verification**: Automatic signature verification of downloaded commits
- **Chain of Trust**: Recursive verification of parent commits ensures complete auditability
- **Graceful Degradation**: Configurable verification levels for different security requirements

### 4. **High-Performance Index System**
- **Hierarchical Tree Structure**: O(log n) file lookup performance even in large repositories
- **In-Memory Caching**: Intelligent caching of frequently accessed index nodes
- **Delta Compression**: Efficient storage of file changes using binary diff algorithms
- **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe index operations for multi-threaded workflows

### 5. **Hybrid Storage Architecture**
- **Snapshot + Delta Strategy**: Periodic full snapshots with incremental deltas for optimal space/time tradeoff
- **Content-Addressable Storage**: All objects stored by SHA-256 hash for deduplication
- **Compression**: LZ4 compression for fast decompression and reduced storage footprint
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic cleanup of unreferenced objects

### 6. **Advanced DAG Operations**
- **Topological Sorting**: Efficient commit ordering for complex merge scenarios
- **Ancestry Queries**: Fast computation of common ancestors and merge bases
- **Conflict Detection**: Intelligent detection and resolution of merge conflicts
- **Visualization Tools**: ASCII art and structured output for DAG analysis

### 7. **Decentralized Architecture**
- **Peer-to-Peer Ready**: No central authority required; all trust based on cryptography
- **Remote Protocol**: Efficient binary protocol for push/pull operations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Built-in strategies for handling concurrent modifications
- **Network Resilience**: Graceful handling of network failures and partial syncs

## Technical Architecture

### **Core Data Structures**

#### **Commit Object**
```rust
struct Commit {
    id: [u8; 32],                    // SHA-256 hash
    parent_ids: Vec<[u8; 32]>,       // Parent commit hashes
    tree_id: [u8; 32],              // Root tree hash
    author: String,                  // Author name
    email: String,                   // Author email
    timestamp: i64,                  // Unix timestamp
    message: String,                 // Commit message
    signature: [u8; 64],            // Ed25519 signature
    public_key: [u8; 32],           // Author's public key
}
```

#### **Index Node (Hierarchical)**
```rust
struct IndexNode {
    name: String,                    // File/directory name
    hash: [u8; 32],                 // Content hash
    mode: u32,                      // File permissions
    children: HashMap<String, IndexNode>, // Subdirectories
    is_directory: bool,             // Directory flag
}
```

#### **Storage Objects**
```rust
enum Object {
    Blob(Vec<u8>),                  // File content
    Tree(Vec<TreeEntry>),           // Directory structure
    Commit(Commit),                 // Commit metadata
    Delta {                         // Incremental changes
        base_hash: [u8; 32],
        patches: Vec<Patch>,
    },
}
```

### **Performance Characteristics**

#### **Time Complexity**
- **File Lookup**: O(log n) average case, O(n) worst case
- **Commit Creation**: O(files changed) + O(log n) for tree updates
- **History Traversal**: O(commits) for linear history, O(n log n) for complex DAGs
- **Merge Operations**: O(common_ancestor_distance) for three-way merges

#### **Space Complexity**
- **Repository Size**: ~1.5x original content (with compression and deduplication)
- **Index Memory**: O(files) with constant overhead per file
- **Working Directory**: O(files) for tracked files only

#### **Network Efficiency**
- **Push/Pull**: Only transfers missing objects and metadata
- **Compression**: LZ4 compression reduces transfer size by ~60-80%
- **Delta Encoding**: Reduces storage requirements by ~70-90% for incremental changes

### **Security Model**

#### **Cryptographic Primitives**
- **Hash Function**: SHA-256 (256-bit output, 128-bit collision resistance)
- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 (255-bit curve, 128-bit security level)
- **Key Derivation**: HKDF-SHA256 for deterministic key generation
- **Random Number Generation**: OS-provided CSPRNG (getrandom crate)

#### **Attack Resistance**
- **Replay Attacks**: Prevented by commit timestamps and parent hashes
- **Collision Attacks**: Mitigated by SHA-256's collision resistance
- **Quantum Attacks**: Ed25519 provides 128-bit post-quantum security
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Constant-time operations where applicable

#### **Audit Trail**
- **Complete History**: Every commit is cryptographically linked to its parents
- **Signature Verification**: All commits can be verified independently
- **Tamper Detection**: Any modification breaks the hash chain
- **Non-Repudiation**: Signatures prove authorship beyond reasonable doubt

## Recent Major Features

### Multi-VCS Clone Support
Helix can now clone repositories from multiple version control systems:
- **Helix** (native)
- **Git** (via `git2` library)
- **Mercurial (hg)**, **Subversion (svn)**, **Bazaar (bzr)** (via system CLI)

**Usage:**
```bash
hx clone <url>
```
- The VCS type is auto-detected from the URL.
- If the required tool (e.g., `hg`, `svn`, `bzr`) is not installed, a clear error message is shown.

### Arch Linux (AUR) Packaging
- Helix is available as [`helix-vcs`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/helix-vcs) on the Arch User Repository.
- The PKGBUILD is maintained in this repository.
- The package installs the `hx` binary, license, and documentation.

**Install on Arch Linux:**
```bash
yay -S helix-vcs
# or
paru -S helix-vcs
```

### Automated AUR Updates
- A GitHub Actions workflow automatically updates the AUR package on every new tagged release.
- This ensures Arch users always have access to the latest stable version of Helix with minimal manual intervention.
